Alice and Bob want to agree on a secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. Unfortunately for them, they did not pay enough attention to the theory (sleeping on a CA class?). Their choice of prime modulus was "imprudent".

Eve was able to record the entire exchange of messages between Alice and Bob. Here's what she found:

p=9459040338068898689261456459355656735760126665215411768729930709057649580926326656219024573411869732770921533628486688534108189813533765746159096301632668722327

r=5  (the primitive root)

Alice sends A=4273882268770451042535779967439697351016686492206027478809543375227950930138924865543470033644860424586440579542980690863469253402996371905611340139885738693080 to Bob.

Bob sends B=3847640689624364711664886026800290793265399414700736841705321414309213654447740358930872088921683993690069628098925077346749794347163383463395658935649932413838 to Alice.

Eve hired you to find the secret key. Can you do it (using maybe less than one hour of CPU time)?
